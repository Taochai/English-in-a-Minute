Welcome to English in a minute. If you have trouble with a friend or a co-worker, maybe you should do this. 
I`m afriad that I must have done something to hurts mary`s feelings. She has been so unfriendly recently to me. I told her I wanna clear
the air, but she turned  and walked away from me. In my office, there has been so many rumors, my boss called a meeting to clear the
air.
Clear the air, this idiom comes from the fact that when there is smoke or fog in the air, it is difficult to see. Sometimes, when people
are angry or dislike someone, they 
hide the reason for the feelings. Clear the air means they bring those issues out in the open, to work through them. This can be applied to both personal
and work situations.
